# PlantDiseaseAI
Plant Disease Detection using Pretrained Models 🌱🔍  This project uses pretrained deep learning models for detecting plant diseases. Leveraging transfer learning, it classifies plant leaf images efficiently. Built with TensorFlow/PyTorch, it supports real-time predictions and can be deployed via Streamlit or Flask. 🚀
